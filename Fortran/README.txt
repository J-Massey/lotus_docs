readme file for the fortran literature directory:
=================================================

This is the place where to share useful PDFs and links to better understand and learn about the fortran language. I think the best way to keep this organised is to have the name of the PDF and a short description on why its a useful read.

Happy read and good luck

  Having had no previous experience with the language and having the need to quickly learn it. It has proven to be a quick set of tutorials to get my head around the basic concepts. However it does not cover object oriented aspects.

- fortran-novella-Holcomb.pdf

  Another good tutorial that does cover the object oriented aspect of the language. Disadvantage of being a book type of tutorial. Advantage of being very brief (100p) which shouldn't take too long to go through. (will add more comments when I finish going through it)
